        <h4>About the Instant Runoff Method</h4>
        <p>The instant runoff method is a sort of extensions of the plurality method with takes advantage of the fact that the given rankings are linear,
            that is to say that if A is preferred over B and B is preferred over C, A is preferred over C. In this method instead of determining a plurality winner,
            the plularity loser is determined (the candidate with the fewest first-place votes) and subsequently removed from the ballot. Then all of the votes are shifted up
            (if B was a voter's first choice and A was a voter's second choice and B was removed from the ballot, A would now be the voter's first choice) and the process is repeated until
            a candidate has a majority.
